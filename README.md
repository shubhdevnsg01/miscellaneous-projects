# miscellaneous-projects
these are some basics html css projects that I have made when I had started learning html,css.

The 1st project is a contact form that I made in a workshop conducted by DSC JIIT.

The 2nd project is a replica of a website that I made for practice.
replicating existing websites is a good way to practice and hone your skills.
